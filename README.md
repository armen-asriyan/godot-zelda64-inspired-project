# godot-zelda64-inspired-project
A demo project inspired by Legend of Zelda games on Nintendo 64 using Godot game engine.


**Concept & Planning:**

1. **Define the Experience:**

   - Craft a unique environment inspired by the games' atmosphere (peaceful, mysterious, etc.). 
   - Set a clear goal for the player (reach a location, solve a simple puzzle, etc.).

2. **Level Design:**

   - Sketch a basic layout of the level. 
   - Plan for a small, self-contained area that showcases exploration and interaction.

3. **Gameplay Mechanics:**

   - Focus on basic movement mechanics (walk, run, jump etc).
   -  Incorporate interactions like collecting rocks and throwing them.
   - Add NPC to talk with (with Zelda style dialog system)

**Building the World in Blender:**

1. **Low-Poly Modeling:**

   - Learn low-poly modeling techniques in Blender.
   - Create basic geometric placeholder shapes for the environment.

2. **Texturing:**

   - Use Photoshop or something else to create textures with a limited color palette and resolution, mimicking the N64 aesthetic.

3. **Optimization:**

   - Keep the polygon count of the models low to ensure smooth performance on my ðŸ¥” laptop.
   - Use techniques like texture baking to optimize textures for better performance in Godot.

**Importing Assets into Godot:**

1. **Scenes and Layouts:**

   - Decide on if there will be multiple scenes.
   - Import the 3D models and textures into these scenes.

2. **Lighting and Atmosphere:**

   - Use Godot's lighting tools to create the desired mood (soft lighting for a peaceful feel, etc.)

3. **Camera Control:**

   - Script basic camera control in GDScript to follow the player character.
   - Thirs Person Camera Controller.

**Learn GDScript:**

1. **Scripting Basics:**

   - Follow online tutorials or Godot's documentation to learn the fundamentals of GDScript.
   - This includes variables, functions, and control flow structures.

2. **Movement Implementation:**

   - Use GDScript to program basic character movement like walking, running, and jumping.

3. **Interaction Mechanics:**

   - Script mechanics for picking up rocks (collision detection, inventory - optional).
   - Implement throwing rocks using basic projectile motion in GDScript.

4. **NPC Interactions:**

   - Script conversations with NPCs using GDScript (dialogue trees, text display).
   - Consider simple quests or tasks for the player to complete.

**Audio:**

1. **Background Music:**

   - Use Ableton Live to create a background music track that complements the atmosphere.

2. **Sound Effects:**

   - Use Audacity and/or Abelton to create simple sound effects for footsteps, environmental sounds (wind, birds), throwing rocks, and NPC interactions.

**Testing & Polishing (Ongoing):**

1. **Playtesting:**

   - Regularly playtest the game to identify bugs, refine the gameplay experience.

2. **Polishing & Optimization:**

   - Focus on making the game feel polished. This includes adding details like particle effects, basic animations, and menus.
   - Optimize the game for performance on my ðŸ¥” laptop. This might involve adjusting lighting settings, reducing the number of objects in a sce# godot-zelda64-inspired-project
